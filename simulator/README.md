# ‚öΩ Soccer Simulator Documentation

## üß≠ Overview

The **Soccer Simulator** provides two core functionalities:

1. **Player Generation** ‚Äì create realistic soccer players with skill attributes, nationalities, and positions.
2. **Game Simulation** ‚Äì simulate full soccer matches between two teams, including statistics, substitutions, and detailed logs.

---

## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 1. Player Simulation

The simulator can generate soccer players with a variety of skill profiles and traits.

### üßæ Example Player JSON

```json
{
  "name": "Jo√£o Vaz",
  "country": "Brazil",
  "position": "Striker",
  "current_position": "Striker",
  "original_position": "Striker",
  "age": 24,
  "is_active": true,
  "injured_until": "",
  "max_skill_level": 83,
  "retirement_age": 35,
  "skills": {
    "shooting": 99,
    "passing": 99,
    "dribbling": 99,
    "defense": 99,
    "physical": 99,
    "speed": 99,
    "stamina": 99,
    "vision": 99,
    "crossing": 99,
    "finishing": 99,
    "aggression": 99,
    "composure": 99,
    "control": 99,
    "intuition": 0,
    "handling": 0,
    "kicking": 0,
    "reflexes": 0
  },
  "card": "NONE",
  "offensive_instructions": [],
  "defensive_instructions": [],
  "height_cm": 160
}
```

### üîß Player Generation Endpoint

The **Player Generation API** allows clients to create customized player profiles.

**Parameters:**

* `skill_range` *(number)* ‚Äì defines the average range for the player‚Äôs skill attributes.
* `position` *(string)* ‚Äì specifies the player‚Äôs main position (e.g., ‚ÄúStriker‚Äù, ‚ÄúGoalkeeper‚Äù, ‚ÄúMidfielder‚Äù).

---

### üß† Name Generation Logic

The simulator includes a randomized name generation system (`src/logics/generate_random_name.rs`):

1. A random country is selected from a predefined list.
2. The simulator loads a corresponding JSON file from `data/name/{country}.json`, containing first and last names.
3. If no file is found, an **‚Äúalien‚Äù name** is generated.
4. There is a **4% probability** that the generated name combines parts from two different countries for diversity.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Attributes

* **position**: The player‚Äôs default, natural position.
* **current_position**: The current in-game assignment.
* **original_position**: The base role for performance reference.

---

### üß© Instructions and Cards

* **Instructions** ‚Äì `offensive_instructions` and `defensive_instructions` modify how a player behaves in-game.
* **Cards** ‚Äì the `card` field can apply modifiers (e.g., skill boosts or penalties) to simulate form or conditions.

---

## üèüÔ∏è 2. Game Simulation

The **Game Simulation** module models a complete soccer match between two teams.

---

### üß± Team JSON Structure

The simulator expects the following structure for both teams:

```json
{
  "team_a": {
    "name": "Team Alpha",
    "players": [],
    "bench_players": [],
    "aura": [],
    "substitutions": [
      { "minute": 45, "player_out": 0, "player_in": 0 },
      { "minute": 60, "player_out": 2, "player_in": 3 }
    ]
  },
  "team_b": {
    "name": "Team Beta",
    "players": [],
    "bench_players": [],
    "aura": [],
    "substitutions": [
      { "minute": 70, "player_out": 5, "player_in": 8 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üìä Game Simulation Return Structure

After simulation, the server returns a **`GameResult`** JSON representing the entire match.
