# ⚽ Soccer Simulator Documentation

## 🧭 Overview

The **Soccer Simulator** provides two core functionalities:

1. **Player Generation** – create realistic soccer players with skill attributes, nationalities, and positions.
2. **Game Simulation** – simulate full soccer matches between two teams, including statistics, substitutions, and detailed logs.

---

## 🧍‍♂️ 1. Player Simulation

The simulator can generate soccer players with a variety of skill profiles and traits.

### 🧾 Example Player JSON

### 🔧 Player Generation Endpoint

The **Player Generation API** allows clients to create customized player profiles.

**Parameters:**

- `skill_range` _(number)_ – defines the average range for the player’s skill attributes.
- `position` _(string)_ – specifies the player’s main position (e.g., “Striker”, “Goalkeeper”, “Midfielder”).

---

### 🧠 Name Generation Logic

The simulator includes a randomized name generation system (`src/logics/generate_random_name.rs`):

1. A random country is selected from a predefined list.
2. The simulator loads a corresponding JSON file from `data/name/{country}.json`, containing first and last names.
3. If no file is found, an **“alien” name** is generated.
4. There is a **4% probability** that the generated name combines parts from two different countries for diversity.

---

### ⚙️ Player Attributes

- **position**: The player’s default, natural position.
- **current_position**: The current in-game assignment.
- **original_position**: The base role for performance reference.

---

### 🧩 Instructions and Cards

- **Instructions** – `offensive_instructions` and `defensive_instructions` modify how a player behaves in-game.
- **Cards** – the `card` field can apply modifiers (e.g., skill boosts or penalties) to simulate form or conditions.

---

## 🏟️ 2. Game Simulation

The **Game Simulation** module models a complete soccer match between two teams.

---

### 🧱 Team JSON Structure

The simulator expects the following structure for both teams:

```json
{
  "team_a": {
    "name": "Team Alpha",
    "players": [],
    "bench_players": [],
    "aura": [],
    "substitutions": [
      { "minute": 45, "player_out": 0, "player_in": 0 },
      { "minute": 60, "player_out": 2, "player_in": 3 }
    ]
  },
  "team_b": {
    "name": "Team Beta",
    "players": [],
    "bench_players": [],
    "aura": [],
    "substitutions": [{ "minute": 70, "player_out": 5, "player_in": 8 }]
  }
}
```

## 📊 Game Simulation Return Structure

After simulation, the server returns a **`GameResult`** JSON representing the entire match.

### 🧾 Example Response

```json
{
  "logs": {
    "player_name": "Raul Almeida",
    "minute": 0,
    "description": "failed.shoot",
    "player_number": 1,
    "team_name": "Team Alphabet"
  },

## 🧩 Summary

The **Soccer Simulator** offers:

- **Player creation** with realistic attributes and name generation.
- **Match simulation** between two dynamically generated teams.
- **Detailed statistics and event logging** for analytics, visualization, or AI model training.

The simulator’s output is serialized as JSON and can be integrated into web services, dashboards, or game engines.

---

## ⚙️ Mechanics

1. Game starts and first validate the lineup to avoid miss players and wrong positions in the team.
2. The simulator calculates the aura, card_boosts and country boosts, this actions increase the players skills.
3. Start the match, for this set the ball possession.
4. The players loads the data/positions/xxx.json witch provides the probabilities for select an action.
5. The players execute this actions for ex: teams[0].players[5] pass the ball...
6. When all sub-actions related to the selected action are finished, another action is selected.
7. Every 5 actions, the minute is incremented by 1.
8. Return the result of the match, providing logs (as a comment system) and also the result (as score).

---

## Todo

    This system is unfinished, needs to add penalties, improve the selection of the teams when any kind of pass success,
    also needs to create a system witch provides a accurate stats in the game and even in the players, for finish needs to
    define a system to reduce the goals when one team scores a lot of goals, a gaussian bell could be an interesting approach.

    Another important think is update the testing system, just test 99 and 55 teams is not enough.

    For the moment, I am keeping the simulator without these upgrades; creating the backend and frontend is more important now.
